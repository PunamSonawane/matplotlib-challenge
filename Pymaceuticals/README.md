* Created a scatter plots including errorbar that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plots including errorbar that shows how the number of [metastatic](cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.


Below are the 3 observations generated from the results of the study:

1.Capomulin is most effective drug 1 )To reduce the Tumor volume 2) limiting metastatic spread 3) Survival Rate.

2.For Tumor volume change katapril is the least effective drug whereas Capomulin is most effective drug 

3.Mice treated with Infubinol had less tumor growth and metastatic site spread than those treated with Ketapril or 
placebo, but the mortality rate was higher than the other two.
